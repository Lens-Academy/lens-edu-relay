Intelligence can seem like a collection of various distinct skills when comparing individual humans, and yet all of them are found almost exclusively in humans as opposed to other animals.

`<TLDR text (optional, the bot can see all the text on the page)>`

Discussion topics to explore:
- `<Discussion point 1>`
- `<Discussion point 2>`
- `<Discussion point 3>`
- `<Discussion point 4>`

Ask what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain `<key concept>` in their own words—it's a key concept.
