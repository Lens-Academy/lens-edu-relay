### Video: The power of intelligence
source:: [[../video_transcripts/miri-al-alignment-why-its-hard-and-where-to-start]]

#### Text
content::
The problem of AI alignment requires a rigorous theoretical foundation. To successfully guide a missile, humanity first had to develop differential calculus, which allowed it to describe the laws of gravity and the motion of bodies. Without this mathematical apparatus, the launch of a powerful missile would result in a series of catastrophic explosions. Like rocket science, AI safety is a high-level engineering challenge. This video explains: an intuitive understanding of goals is insufficient for controlling superhuman systems. We need formal laws describing the behavior of powerful optimizers. Only with a reliable "mathematics of alignment" will we be able to guarantee the stability of an AI's trajectory.

#### Video-excerpt
from:: 42:53
to:: 1:00:00


#### Text
content::
`<prompt the user on how they should interact with the chatbot>`
#### Chat: Discussion on X-Risk
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
`<TLDR text (optional, the bot can see all the text on the page)>`

Discussion topics to explore:
- `<Discussion point 1>`
- `<Discussion point 2>`
- `<Discussion point 3>`
- `<Discussion point 4>`

Ask what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain `<key concept>` in their own words—it's a key concept.
