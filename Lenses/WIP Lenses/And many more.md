And still we are only scratching the tip of the iceberg. Perhaps you'll want to sit down and think of a few more advantages you could imagine an artificial mind having over us yourself, before you read the following non-exhaustive list.

#### Article-excerpt
to:: "`<an exact quote from the article where the exerpt should stop>`"

#### Text
content::
`<prompt the user on how they should interact with the chatbot>`
#### Chat: Discussion on X-Risk
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
`<TLDR text (optional, the bot can see all the text on the page)>`

Discussion topics to explore:
- `<Discussion point 1>`
- `<Discussion point 2>`
- `<Discussion point 3>`
- `<Discussion point 4>`

Ask what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain `<key concept>` in their own words—it's a key concept.

The user just answered the question: `<tell the chatbot what prompt the user is responding to>`
