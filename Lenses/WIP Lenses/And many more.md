And still we are only scratching the tip of the iceberg. Perhaps you'll want to sit down and think of a few more advantages you could imagine an artificial mind having over us yourself, before you read the following non-exhaustive list.

Surely the number of yet-unimagined advantages is even greater. Do you have questions about some of these "superpowers"? Perhaps one of them strikes you as especially powerful.

#### Chat: Discussion on X-Risk
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:
A list of advantages powerful artificial intelligences would have over humans from Bostrom's book "Superintelligence", each with a short description. The list includes the speed of computational elements compared to neurons, the internal communication speed compared to the speed of action potential through axons, the possible number of computational elements, storage capacity, reliability, lifespan and the  precision of sensors as well as editability, duplicability, goal coordination, memory sharing and modular expandability.

Discussion topics to explore:
- Were you able to come up with even more of these "superpowers"?
- Examples of how some of these could be used to a decisive advantage
- How could humans keep up?
- Which of these seem especially important and why?

Ask what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain two of these advantages in their own words—it's a key concept.
