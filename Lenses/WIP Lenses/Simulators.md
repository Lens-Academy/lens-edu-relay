### Article: Simulators
source:: [[janus-simulators]]

#### Text
content::
When discussing AI impact and risks, people often speak of AI as agents, oracles, or other forms of AI actively influencing the world and human understanding. How do these ideas align with what we see in LLMs? Simulator theory shows how, in certain circumstances, an LLM might behave like an agent, oracle, or tool because it can simulate instances of these kinds of systems. The following material provides a brief overview of the "simulators" concept.

How can LLMs exhibit the properties of oracles, agents, or tools while remaining statistical predictors?
#### Chat: Discussion on X-Risk
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:{>>Example: 
AI x-risk is the hypothesis that AGI/superintelligence could cause human extinction
or irreversible collapse. The risk combines: capability advantages, recursive
self-improvement, and emerging dangerous capabilities (manipulation, cyberattacks,
bioweapons)—amplified by competitive "race to the bottom" dynamics. The core crux
is alignment: specifying goals, ensuring corrigibility, handling instrumental
convergence. Intelligence and values are orthogonal—moral behavior isn't automatic.<<}
`<TLDR text>`

Discussion topics to explore:{>>Examples:
- What is "instrumental convergence"? Why would any smart AI seek self-preservation and resources?
- What is the "Gorilla Problem" (Stuart Russell's analogy)?
- How do "Monkey's Paw" or "King Midas" effects apply to goal specification?
- What do skeptics like Yann LeCun argue, and what are the counter-arguments?
- Why might "kill switches" fail against superintelligence?<<}

Ask what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain `<key concept>` in their own words—it's a key concept.
