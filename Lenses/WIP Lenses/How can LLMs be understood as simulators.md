instructions::
TLDR of what the user just read:{>>Example: 
AI x-risk is the hypothesis that AGI/superintelligence could cause human extinction
or irreversible collapse. The risk combines: capability advantages, recursive
self-improvement, and emerging dangerous capabilities (manipulation, cyberattacks,
bioweapons)—amplified by competitive "race to the bottom" dynamics. The core crux
is alignment: specifying goals, ensuring corrigibility, handling instrumental
convergence. Intelligence and values are orthogonal—moral behavior isn't automatic.<<}
`<TLDR text>`

Discussion topics to explore:{>>Examples:
- What is "instrumental convergence"? Why would any smart AI seek self-preservation and resources?
- What is the "Gorilla Problem" (Stuart Russell's analogy)?
- How do "Monkey's Paw" or "King Midas" effects apply to goal specification?
- What do skeptics like Yann LeCun argue, and what are the counter-arguments?
- Why might "kill switches" fail against superintelligence?<<}

Ask what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain `<key concept>` in their own words—it's a key concept.
