!# Welcome to AI Safetys

We begin by examining the potential of AI and the risks and opportunities
that the characteristics of this technology present to humanity.

Watch this video from Kurzgesagt to understand why artificial intelligence
might be humanity's most important invention.

**Reflection:**

The video describes how humans dominate Earth because of our general
intelligence. It also explains the difference between narrow AI and AGI. In your own words, what is the difference between narrow and general intelligence?

## Chat
instructions::
TLDR of what the user just watched:
Humans dominate Earth because general intelligence enabled cumulative knowledge.
Modern AI evolved from narrow tools into opaque "black box" learning systems.

Discussion topics to explore:
- What is intelligence as "problem-solving ability" and why is it a source of power?
- Why are neural networks called "black boxes"?
- What's the difference between narrow AI (like ChatGPT) and AGI?

Start by asking what stood out or surprised them. Use Socratic questioning to
check their understanding of these concepts.

The video introduces the concept of an **intelligence explosion** - a rapid,
recursive cycle of AI self-improvement that could outpace human oversight.

## Chat
instructions::
The user just watched the second half of the video about AI risks.

Discussion topics:
- How could an "intelligence explosion" happen through recursive self-improvement?
- Why might controlling superintelligent AI be difficult?

Check if they understand why speed of improvement matters.
